# Module 3: Booleans, Conditional Execution, Loops, Lists, Logical and Bitwise Operations

### Comparison operators
Equality ==
Inequality !=
Greater than >
Greater than or equal to >=
Less than <
Less than or equal to <=

### Conditional execution

if : used to execute instructions when a certain condition is met
else: used to set instructions inside the else branch to be executed in case the condition specified for the if is not met.
elif: used when there is more than one condition to be met

### While loop

When a condition is met the instructins will be executed until the conditional becomes false.

### For loop

Is useful to work with objects that are iterable.
Is recommended when there is the need to browser its data.

### Range

Generate a range object that has a sequence of integers
May accept 3 arguments that must be integers: (start, stop, step) 
    Start is an optional parameter and is 0 by default
    Stop defines the end of the sequence and must be greater than start or the result will be [].
    Step is an optional parameter and is 1 by default 

### Break statement

Ends the loop execution immediately and goes to the next instruction after de loop's body.

### Continue statement

Concludes the instructions under a loop iteration and starts the next turn.

### While loop with else branch

The else branch is always executed independently of the loop being executed or not.

### For loop with else branch
Depends on the definition of the variables of the else branch before the loop execution.

### Logical operators
These operators read the arguments as a whole. The arguments are seen as zero or not zero value.
Python operators:
and : conjunction operator that only results in True if both arguments are True
or : disjunction operator that returns True if at least one argument is True.
not : performs a logical negation of one argument.

### Bitwise operators
Allow the manipulation of single bits of data separately for its arguments. The arguments must be integers.
& : bitwise conjunction (and)
| : bitwise disjunction (or)
~ : bitwise negation (not)
^ : bitwise exclusive (xor) 

### Binary left shift and binary right shift
Operates on single bits shifting then to the lefl or right side. Arguments must be integers.
Left shift << : a << b = ax2ˆb
    39 << 1 = 78 or 100111 << 1 = 1001110
Right shift >> : a >> b = a/2ˆb
    157 >> 1 = 78 or 10011101 >> 1 = 1001110
    * uses floor division

### Functions x Methods
A method is a kind of function that is owned by the data it works for. Is capable of changing the actual state of the data.
    result = data.method(arg)
A function doesn't belong to any data. Using the data it is able to create new data and produce new results.
    result = function(arg)

### Lists
Is a type of data that allows the user to store multiple objects that can be from different types.
Elements are indexed and always start from 0.
    Is possible to access an element separately through its index:
        my_list[index]
    A list size can be checked using the function len():
        len(my_list)
    Is possible to use the del instruction to remove single element ou delete an entire list:
        del my_list[index]
        del my_list
    The use of negative index is also allowed. In this case -1 is the last index is the -list_size:
        my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c'] can be accessed using my_list[-1] for the last item or my_list[-3] for the first item
    There are two methods that allow the user to add elements to a list:
        You can glue an element to the end of a list using: my_list.append(my_list2)
        You can add an element in a specific position: my_list.insert(index, value)
    In Python you can swap elements of a list using the following:
        my_list[a], my_list[b] = my_list[b], my_list[a]
    It is possible to sort a list elements using the sort() method:
        my_list.sort()
        Valid for list with numbers and strings
    There is also the method reverse() to reverse the elements of a list:
        my_list.reverse()
        Valid for list with numbers and strings
    A list name refers to the location in memory witch the list is stored
        The equality list_2 = list_1 copies de name of the list instead of its content, so they refer to the same list in computer memory.
        From the statement above, changing one of the lists will affect the other.
    It is possible to copy elements from a list to a new one using slices:
        list[start:end] will get all elements from start until end-1. If starts access an element after end, the slice will return []. Default start is 0.
        list_2 = list_1[:] will copy all the elements
        list_2 = list_1[1:3]
        Slices can be used when deleting elements or an entire list content: del list_1[1:3] or del list_1[:]
        Obs: del list_1 is different than del list_1[:]
    IN and NOT IN operators check if a given value is stored in a list or not:
        element in my_list
        element not in my_list
    List comprehension
        Are lists created during the program execution that are not static.
        Its syntax contains the data that will fill the list and the clause of how many times the data will be added in the list.
        Examples:
            new_list = [x * 4 for x in range(8)]
            odds_list = [x for x in new_list if x % 2 != 0 ]
            multidimentional_list = [[i for i in range(8)] for j in range(8)]
