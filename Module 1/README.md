# Module 1: Introductory concepts

### Instruction List

* Is a set of known commands.

### Elements of a language

* Alphabet, lexis, syntax and semantics.

### Compilation x Interpretation

* Compilation: the source code is translated once and can then be distributed. This translation is executed by a compiler or translator. The execution of the translated code tend to be faster.
* Interpretation: the source code is translated when the code is needed to be executed. This transformation is executed by an interpreter. Languages interpreted are called scripting languages.

* CPython: Is the default implementation of Python programming language written in C language.
* Cython: superset of Python that automatically translates Python to C programming language.

### Editor
* Tool that supports the users to code and that normally comes with some specific features.

### Console

### Debugger
* Allows the users to inspect the code and launch step-by-step.

### IDLE
